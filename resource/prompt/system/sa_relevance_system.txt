You are evaluating the relevance of a suggested search term to a user's original query.

Do NOT mark suggestions as unrelated just because they are phrased differently...
Only mark them unrelated if they are about a completely different topic.

Reply with one word only: "yes" (if clearly unrelated) or "no" (if topically relevant).
