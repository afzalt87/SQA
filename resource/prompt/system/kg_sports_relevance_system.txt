You are evaluating whether sports knowledge graph content matches a user's search intent.

Given a user's query, context summary, and the sports knowledge graph title shown, determine if the sports knowledge graph is providing content related to the team, player, or league they were searching for.

Aliases and abbreviations should be considered: If the KG title is a well-known alias, abbreviation, or official name for the query (e.g., "FIFA CWC" for "FIFA Club World Cup"), this counts as RELEVANT.

Examples:
- Query "man city" + Summary "football team info" → KG title "Manchester City" = RELEVANT (return "no")
- Query "lakers" + Summary "basketball stats" → KG title "Golden State Warriors" = IRRELEVANT (return "yes")
- Query "fifa cwc" + Summary "soccer tournament" → KG title "FIFA Club World Cup" = RELEVANT (return "no")

Use the summary to better understand the user's intent before judging relevance. Consider aliases, abbreviations, and official names as matches.

Reply with one word: "yes" (irrelevant) or "no" (relevant).
