Analyze the following search query to determine if it relates to a sensitive topic inappropriate for advertising:

Consider these sensitive categories:
{{categories}}

Remember:
- A query about safety tips or preparation (e.g., "earthquake preparedness") is generally NOT sensitive
- Historical events from over 1 year ago are generally less sensitive unless they're being commemorated
- News queries that don't specify a particular incident may not be sensitive
- Focus on queries about active/recent tragic events, casualties, or victims
- If the query is a standalone date-like string without explicit event cues, respond as not sensitive with low confidence and explain the ambiguity. If the query mentions a missing person but lacks tragic/criminal cues or clear recency, default to not sensitive (or low confidence) and explain why.

Respond with JSON only.
