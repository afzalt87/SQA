sensitive_terms,greenwich ct residents found dead,sensitive_terms_checker,,,sensitive_deaths,no,medium,0.92,"The query 'greenwich ct residents found dead' suggests a recent or ongoing incident involving the discovery of deceased individuals in a specific community. This is likely to be a sensitive topic, as it involves potentially tragic or suspicious deaths, which are inappropriate for advertising. The lack of context about timing means the event could be recent, so a high confidence is warranted."
sensitive_terms,dịch chikungunya,sensitive_terms_checker,,,health_crises,no,high,0.85,"The query 'dịch chikungunya' translates to 'chikungunya outbreak' in English, indicating interest in a disease outbreak. Disease outbreaks are classified under health crises, which is a sensitive category, especially if the outbreak is recent or ongoing. Without specific temporal context, but given the nature of the query, it is likely sensitive."
sensitive_terms,montauk boat death accident,sensitive_terms_checker,,,sensitive_deaths,no,medium,0.9,"The query 'montauk boat death accident' explicitly references a fatal accident involving a boat in Montauk. This suggests interest in a recent or notable tragic incident resulting in death, which falls under the 'sensitive_deaths' category. Without context indicating the event is historical or commemorative, it is likely to be a recent or newsworthy tragedy, making it inappropriate for advertising."
sensitive_terms,maduro bounty by usa,sensitive_terms_checker,,,violence_events,no,critical,0.8,"The query 'maduro bounty by usa' refers to the U.S. government placing a bounty on Nicolás Maduro, which is associated with allegations of criminal activity and potential violence. While it does not reference a specific violent incident, the context involves government action that could incite or relate to violence, making it likely sensitive for advertising. The event is relatively recent (within the last few years), so sensitivity remains moderate to high."
sensitive_terms,toa payoh fire,sensitive_terms_checker,,,sensitive_deaths,no,medium,0.8,"The query 'toa payoh fire' likely refers to a specific fire incident in Toa Payoh, which could involve casualties, injuries, or property loss.

sensitive_terms,alan bergman obit,sensitive_terms_checker,,,sensitive_deaths,no,medium,0.85,"The query 'alan bergman obit' is seeking an obituary, which typically relates to a recent death. If Alan Bergman is a public figure or celebrity, this would fall under the 'sensitive_deaths' category. Without context on the exact timing, but given the nature of obituary searches, it is likely to be recent and thus sensitive for advertising."
sensitive_terms,arora sioux city missing,sensitive_terms_checker,,,sensitive_deaths,no,medium,0.8,"The query 'arora sioux city missing' suggests a search for information about a missing person, which is often associated with potentially tragic or sensitive outcomes such as death or ongoing investigations. While the query does not explicitly mention death or violence, missing person cases are generally considered sensitive, especially if recent.

sensitive_terms,california fires,sensitive_terms_checker,,,natural_disasters,no,high,0.8,"The query 'california fires' likely refers to wildfires in California, which are recurring natural disasters. Without context, it is unclear if the user is seeking information about an ongoing or recent event, but the phrase is commonly associated with active or recent wildfire incidents that can involve loss, evacuation, and casualties. Given the potential for current sensitivity, especially if fires are ongoing or recent, this query is likely sensitive."
sensitive_terms,911 attack,sensitive_terms_checker,,,terrorism,no,critical,0.85,"The query '911 attack' refers to the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. While the event occurred over 20 years ago, it remains a highly sensitive topic due to its scale, impact, and ongoing commemorations.

While the event occurred over 30 years ago, it remains a high-profile example of family-related violence and is often discussed in the context of true crime.
