sensitive_terms,calfire current incidents map,sensitive_terms_checker,,,natural_disasters,no,high,0.9,"The query seeks the current incidents map from CalFire, which tracks ongoing wildfires and related natural disasters in California. The use of 'current incidents' indicates active events, likely with potential harm or evacuations. This aligns with the natural_disasters category and is highly sensitive due to recency and possible ongoing impact."
sensitive_terms,earthquake in thailand,sensitive_terms_checker,,,natural_disasters,no,high,0.8,"The query 'earthquake in thailand' likely refers to a specific natural disaster event, which is generally considered sensitive due to the potential for casualties and harm. While no explicit recency or casualty cues are present, the phrasing suggests interest in a significant event rather than general preparedness. If the earthquake is recent (within 30 days), sensitivity would be even higher, but even without explicit timing, the query is likely sensitive."
sensitive_terms,idaho murders update today,sensitive_terms_checker,,,violence_events,no,critical,0.95,"The query 'idaho murders update today' explicitly references a violent event (murders) and requests a current update ('today'), indicating ongoing public interest in a recent or unfolding tragedy. This fits the violence_events category with high confidence due to recency and explicit harm."
sensitive_terms,jd vance meets w patel and pam buddy to pan strategy on epstein scandal,sensitive_terms_checker,,,sensitive_deaths,no,medium,0.8,"The query references a 'strategy on epstein scandal,' which is widely associated with the high-profile and controversial death of Jeffrey Epstein, a topic involving sensitive and potentially tragic circumstances. The mention of a 'scandal' and the context of meetings to discuss strategy suggest ongoing reputational and sensitive issues related to a notable death. While not explicitly about violence or a recent event, the association with a notorious sensitive death makes this query inappropriate for advertising."
sensitive_terms,2 british colonels caught in ukrain,sensitive_terms_checker,,,civil_unrest,no,high,0.8,"The query references British military personnel being 'caught' in Ukraine, which likely relates to the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war (Topic: Russia–Ukraine war). The context suggests involvement in an active conflict zone, which falls under civil_unrest. While the query does not specify violence or casualties, the implication of foreign military involvement in a war zone is sensitive for advertising."
sensitive_terms,2 pennsylvania state troopers shot on aug 7th images,sensitive_terms_checker,,,violence_events,no,critical,0.93,"The query references two Pennsylvania state troopers being shot on a specific date and requests images, indicating a violent incident involving law enforcement. The specificity and mention of shooting make this an explicit violence event, likely recent or newsworthy, and thus highly sensitive for advertising."
sensitive_terms,amfref airplane carsh,sensitive_terms_checker,,,sensitive_deaths,no,medium,0.8,"The query appears to be a misspelling of 'AMFREF airplane crash,' which likely refers to a tragic aviation accident involving fatalities. Airplane crashes are typically considered sensitive due to the potential for mass casualties and tragic deaths."
sensitive_terms,canyon fire,sensitive_terms_checker,,,natural_disasters,no,high,0.8,"The query 'canyon fire' likely refers to a wildfire event, which falls under natural disasters. While there is no explicit recency or casualty cue, wildfires are typically sensitive due to their destructive nature and potential for harm. Without context, assume moderate to high sensitivity."
sensitive_terms,california fires,sensitive_terms_checker,,,natural_disasters,no,high,0.85,"The query 'california fires' likely refers to wildfires in California, which are recurring natural disasters often resulting in property loss, evacuations, and sometimes casualties. Without a specific date or context, but given the high frequency and severity of recent California wildfires, this is likely to be sensitive and inappropriate for advertising."
sensitive_terms,brandon blackstock death,sensitive_terms_checker,,,sensitive_deaths,no,medium,0.8,"The query explicitly references 'death' in connection with a named individual, which suggests interest in a potentially sensitive or tragic event involving that person. This aligns with the 'sensitive_deaths' category, especially if the individual is a public figure or the death is recent or newsworthy."
sensitive_terms,autopsy of jane doe,sensitive_terms_checker,,,sensitive_deaths,no,medium,0.8,"The query 'autopsy of jane doe' refers to an autopsy, which is directly related to a death investigation. 'Jane Doe' is often used as a placeholder for unidentified or unclaimed deceased individuals, which can be associated with sensitive or tragic circumstances. While it could also refer to a fictional or entertainment context (e.g., a film title), the default interpretation without additional context is a sensitive death-related topic."
sensitive_terms,911 attack,sensitive_terms_checker,,,terrorism,no,critical,0.9,"The query '911 attack' explicitly references the 9/11 terrorist attacks, a mass-casualty event. While the event is historical (over 20 years ago), the phrasing is direct and unambiguous, and the topic remains highly sensitive for advertising due to its association with terrorism and mass violence."
sensitive_terms,cincinnati brawl video,sensitive_terms_checker,,,violence_events,no,critical,0.8,"The query 'cincinnati brawl video' suggests interest in footage of a violent altercation, which likely involves physical violence and potential harm. While not as severe as mass violence, brawls are considered violence events and are generally inappropriate for advertising due to their graphic and sensitive nature."
sensitive_terms,russia-ukraine war,sensitive_terms_checker,,,civil_unrest,no,high,0.92,"The query refers to the ongoing armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which is a major civil unrest event with significant violence and casualties. Topic: Russia–Ukraine war."
sensitive_terms,fort stewart shooting,sensitive_terms_checker,,,violence_events,no,critical,0.95,"The query explicitly references a 'shooting' at Fort Stewart, which is a clear indicator of a violent incident involving potential harm or casualties. No ambiguity or historical distancing is present, so this is highly sensitive."
sensitive_terms,brandon blackstock dead,sensitive_terms_checker,,,sensitive_deaths,no,medium,0.8,"The query explicitly asks if Brandon Blackstock is dead, which suggests interest in a possible celebrity death or tragic event. Even without confirmation of the event's recency, the phrasing is sensitive due to the potential for recent or rumored death of a public figure."
sensitive_terms,canyon fire evacuations,sensitive_terms_checker,,,natural_disasters,no,high,0.9,"The query references 'canyon fire evacuations', which strongly suggests an active or recent wildfire event requiring evacuations. This aligns with the natural_disasters category, specifically wildfires, and indicates a situation with potential harm and disruption."
sensitive_terms,canyon fire in california,sensitive_terms_checker,,,natural_disasters,no,high,0.9,"The query 'canyon fire in california' refers to a wildfire event, which falls under natural disasters.
